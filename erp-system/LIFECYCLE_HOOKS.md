## 📝 Implementation Notes

1. **Email Service**: All email functionality is implemented as console logs with commented placeholder code for actual email service integration.

2. **User Management**: Employee user account creation is commented out as it requires the users-permissions plugin configuration.

3. **Audit Logging**: Basic audit logging is implemented as console logs. A proper audit-log entity would need to be created for full functionality.

4. **Error Handling**: All hooks include proper error handling and user-friendly error messages.

5. **TypeScript**: All hooks are implemented with proper TypeScript types and async/await patterns.

## 🚀 Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. Set up email service integration (Strapi Email plugin or external service)
2. Create audit-log content type for proper audit trail
3. Configure users-permissions plugin for employee account management
4. Add more sophisticated stock reservation logic
5. Implement inventory valuation and accounting integration
6. Add more business rules as needed

All the core lifecycle hooks are now in place and ready to handle the business logic for your ERP system!
